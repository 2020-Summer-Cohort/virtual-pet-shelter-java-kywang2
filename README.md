# Virtual Pet Shelter

Think of your fondest childhood memories and you may immediately think of how much fun you had when you played with your tamagotchi and digimon. What if I was to say you could continue playing with a virtual pet...even now as an adult!?

Introducing the newest interactive game where you get to hang out and play with your favorite virtual buddy, Larry the Lizard but now, you have the option to hang with even more of your favorite virtual friends such as Kenny the Chameleon and Peter the Parrot as we've created a whole shelter of virtual animals.  Watch as you can feed, give water, and play with either one or your whole squad of favorite virtual pals.  Additionally, since they're a part of a whole virtual animal shelter, you have the opportunity to adopt one animal and even admit one of your own if they grow too much for you to care for.  Make sure you take good care of each animal and are constantly looking out for their vital bodily functions as with each turn, each animal's hunger, thirst, playfullness, and tiredness levels increase and if any function get to level 15, they take off and escape from the shelter!

The programming behind this application is that each animal in the virtual animal shelter is a part of an ArrayList that comprises of their name, their description random levels for their 4 major bodily functions: hunger, thirst, playfulness, and sleep. You give a user input for each of the 4 activities: feeding him, giving him water, playing with him, letting him go to sleep, as well as adopting an animal or admitting an animal of your own.  Each activity will affect that respective pet's level of bodily function and if you chose to adopt, it'll remove one of the animals from the ArrayList.  If you choose to admit an animal, you have to enter in their name as well as description and they'll be added to the ArrayList and be included in the animal shelter.  With each turn, each bodily function will automatically increase 1 level and if any of the levels reaches 15, the game is over.

Play with Larry the Lizard or any of his fun pals and let one of them be your new favorite roommate! Who says you're too old to have virtual pets?
